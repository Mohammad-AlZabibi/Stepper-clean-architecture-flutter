# Flutter Stepper in clean architecture with communicating with android native channel 

This project uses the clean architecture approach which separates the code as following: 
- Each feature has it's own folder, each feature folder separated to three layers:
  - presentation.
  - domain.
  - data. 

- Core folder for the common thing that is used in the project. 

- injection container:
  This file is responsible for the injection of the class.
